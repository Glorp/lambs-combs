# Lambdas and combinators and such

You should have a [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) and an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Racket should be on `PATH` so that it can be started with `racket`. If the Emacs can display PNGs then that's a thing it can do. Otherwise it can't. Okay.

Set environment variable `HOME` to this repo-dir, run Emacs. Possibly it could work?
